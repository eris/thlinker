Quick attempt at runtime ELF linker for NDS.
More details @ http://blea.ch/wiki/index.php/Elf_linking

Was intended for older version of libnds and uses various 
custom external libs mostly if not entirely in main.c. The
only relavent function in main.c is:
 elfStart("nitro:/arm-eabi-test.o");

which loads and executes the test functions. 

Hope its useful...
